## General info
There are over 29 million pets in Australia, and we have one of the highest pet ownership rates in the world. Approximately 61% of households in Australia own pets, with dogs being the most common (40%). This means that about one in every ten households owns a dog.  
Dog owners are always concerned about the health care they provide to their pets, and sometimes this could be a very costly affair for the owner. But not when they have us to help them. We will provide the owners with a way to identify such issues and recommend ways to avoid poison pet cases
